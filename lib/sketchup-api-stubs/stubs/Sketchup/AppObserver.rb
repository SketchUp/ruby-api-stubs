# This observer interface is implemented to react to application events.
# This interface is often used to attach other observers to models as they
# are opened or started.
# This ensures that your observers are watching all open models.
#
# For example, when one attaches a {Sketchup::SelectionObserver}, it is only
# attached to the {Sketchup::Selection} collection of a given model. If a 2nd
# model is opened, the new model's selection changes will not fire selection
# callbacks unless you've attached a {Sketchup::SelectionObserver} to the new
# model as well. By watching for {#onNewModel}, you can be sure to do so.
#
# @abstract To implement this observer, create a Ruby class of this type, override the
#   desired methods, and add an instance of the observer to the
#   application class.
#
# @example
#   # This is an example of an observer that watches the application for
#   # new models and shows a messagebox.
#   class MyAppObserver < Sketchup::AppObserver
#     def onNewModel(model)
#       puts "onNewModel: #{model}"
#
#       # Here is where one might attach other observers to the new model.
#       model.selection.add_observer(MySelectionObserver.new)
#     end
#   end
#
#   # Attach the observer
#   Sketchup.add_observer(MyAppObserver.new)
#
# @version SketchUp 6.0
class Sketchup::AppObserver

  # Instance Methods

  # The {#expectsStartupModelNotifications} method is called to determine if the
  # observer expects to receive {#onNewModel} and {#onOpenModel} calls for the
  # models that are created or opened at SketchUp startup. This includes the
  # empty initial model, a model opened via command line arguments, or
  # auto-restored models on Mac OS X.
  #
  # @example
  #   def expectsStartupModelNotifications
  #     return true
  #   end
  #
  # @note Prior to SketchUp 2014, {#onNewModel} and {#onOpenModel} were
  #   not being called for the startup models. This issue is now fixed but
  #   observers still need to express their intent to receive these calls. This is
  #   for back-compatibility with existing scripts which worked around these
  #   missing calls by other means. For new code, this method should be implemented
  #   and should return +true+.
  #
  # @return [Boolean] +true+ to receive {#onNewModel} and {#onOpenModel} calls
  #   for startup models. Return +false+ or simply not
  #   implement the method in order to not receive these calls
  #   (which was the behavior prior to SketchUp 2014).
  #
  # @version SketchUp 2014
  def expectsStartupModelNotifications
  end

  # The {#onActivateModel} method is called when an open model is activated. This
  # is relevant on Mac only which supports multiple documents to be opened
  # simultaneously.
  #
  # @example
  #   def onActivateModel(model)
  #     puts "onActivateModel: #{model}"
  #   end
  #
  # @param [Sketchup::Model] model
  #   The newly-activated model object.
  #
  # @return [nil]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 2015
  def onActivateModel(model)
  end

  # The {#onExtensionsLoaded} method is called when SketchUp has finished loading
  # all extensions when the application starts.
  #
  # @example
  #   def onExtensionsLoaded
  #     puts "onExtensionsLoaded"
  #   end
  #
  # @version SketchUp 2022.0
  def onExtensionsLoaded
  end

  # The {#onNewModel} method is called when the application creates a new, empty
  # model.
  #
  # @example
  #   def onNewModel(model)
  #     puts "onNewModel: #{model}"
  #   end
  #
  # @param [Sketchup::Model] model
  #   The active model object.
  #
  # @return [nil]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def onNewModel(model)
  end

  # The {#onOpenModel} method is called when the application opens an existing
  # model.
  #
  # @example
  #   def onOpenModel(model)
  #     puts "onOpenModel: #{model}"
  #   end
  #
  # @note If a skp file is loaded via the command line or double-clicking on
  #   a skp in explorer (which is also is the command line) then this
  #   observer will not be called.  The Ruby interpreter in SketchUp is
  #   initialized after command line processing so the observer won't
  #   be added in time to get the notification.
  #
  # @param [Sketchup::Model] model
  #   The active model object.
  #
  # @return [nil]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def onOpenModel(model)
  end

  # The {#onQuit} method is called when SketchUp closes. This is useful if you
  # need to clean up anything or store your application state upon close.
  #
  # @example
  #   def onQuit()
  #     puts "onQuit"
  #   end
  #
  # @return [nil]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def onQuit
  end

  # The {#onUnloadExtension} method is called when the user turns off a Ruby
  # extension. This is useful for detecting if the user is deactivating
  # some critical set of observers, for example, so you can warn them
  # or cache your extension state.
  #
  # @example
  #   def onUnloadExtension(extension_name)
  #     puts "onUnloadExtension: #{extension_name}"
  #   end
  #
  # @param [String] extension_name
  #   The name of the extension just unloaded.
  #
  # @return [nil]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 7.0
  def onUnloadExtension(extension_name)
  end
