# The Importer interface lets you build your own importers for SketchUp. To
# use this, you create a subclass of Importer and implement all of the
# methods described below. This will make your importer appear in the list
# that users see under File > Import, and you can use Ruby to do all of the
# work of opening the file and creating whatever you need inside SketchUp.
#
# Here is an example of a complete script that imports a .txt file and
# displays its contents in a messagebox.
#
# @example
#   class TextImporter < Sketchup::Importer
#
#     # This method is called by SketchUp to determine the description that
#     # appears in the File > Import dialog's pulldown list of valid
#     # importers.
#     def description
#       return "Custom Text Importer (*.txt)"
#     end
#
#     # This method is called by SketchUp to determine what file extension
#     # is associated with your importer.
#     def file_extension
#       return "txt"
#     end
#
#     # This method is called by SketchUp to get a unique importer id.
#     def id
#       return "com.sketchup.importers.custom_txt"
#     end
#
#     # This method is called by SketchUp to determine if the "Options"
#     # button inside the File > Import dialog should be enabled while your
#     # importer is selected.
#     def supports_options?
#       return true
#     end
#
#     # This method is called by SketchUp when the user clicks on the
#     # "Options" button inside the File > Import dialog. You can use it to
#     # gather and store settings for your importer.
#     def do_options
#       # In a real use you would probably store this information in an
#       # instance variable.
#       my_settings = UI.inputbox(['My Import Option:'], ['1'],
#         "Import Options")
#     end
#
#     # This method is called by SketchUp after the user has selected a file
#     # to import. This is where you do the real work of opening and
#     # processing the file.
#     def load_file(file_path, status)
#       UI.messagebox(file_path)
#
#       return Sketchup::Importer::ImportSuccess
#     end
#   end
#
#   Sketchup.register_importer(TextImporter.new)
#
# @version SketchUp 6.0
class Sketchup::Importer

  # Constants

  ImportCanceled = nil # Stub value.
  ImportFail = nil # Stub value.
  ImportFileNotFound = nil # Stub value.
  ImportSuccess = nil # Stub value.

  # Instance Methods

  # This method is called by SketchUp to determine the description that appears
  # in the File > Import dialog's pulldown list of valid importers.
  #
  # Though it is common for the description to include the file extension
  # supported by the importer (such as "Text Importer (.txt)"), the actual
  # extension is defined in the file_extension method.
  #
  # @example
  #   def description
  #     return "Custom Text Importer (*.txt)"
  #   end
  #
  # @return description - a brief string description
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def description
  end

  # This method is called by SketchUp when the user clicks on the "Options"
  # button inside the File > Import dialog. You can use it to gather and store
  # settings for your importer.
  #
  # Only applicable if the importer supports options, meaning its
  # supports_options method returns true.
  #
  # @example
  #   def id
  #     return "com.sketchup.importers.custom_txt"
  #   end
  #
  # @return id - an id string
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def do_options
  end

  # This method is called by SketchUp to determine a single file extension is
  # associated with your importer. Only files that match this extension will be
  # shown to the user as they browse their harddrive for things to import.
  #
  # Ruby importers are only allowed to support a single extension.
  #
  # @example
  #   def file_extension
  #     return "txt"
  #   end
  #
  # @return extension - typically a 3-letter string
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def file_extension
  end

  # This method is called by SketchUp to determine a unique identifier for
  # your importer, typically something like "com.sketchup.importers.dxf".
  #
  # @example
  #   def id
  #     return "com.sketchup.importers.custom_txt"
  #   end
  #
  # @return id - an id string
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def id
  end

  # This method is called by SketchUp after the user has selected a file to
  # import. This is where you do the real work by opening the file via Ruby's
  # File object and processing it in whatever way you need.
  #
  # You must return an integer success code to SketchUp when you are done.
  # These are the codes that SketchUp understands:
  #
  #   - Sketchup::Importer::ImportSuccess
  #   - Sketchup::Importer::ImportFail
  #   - Sketchup::Importer::ImportCanceled - SketchUp will show a "cancelled" dialog
  #   - Sketchup::Importer::ImportFileNotFound - SketchUp will show a "not found" dialog
  #
  # @example
  #   def load_file(file_path, status)
  #     # Here is where you would open the file and process it.
  #     puts file_path
  #
  #     return Sketchup::Importer::ImportSuccess
  #   end
  #
  # @param file_path
  #   Absolute path to the file the user selected
  #
  # @param status
  #   The status of the import so far. Contains true.
  #
  # @return success - an integer status code. See above.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def load_file(file_path, status)
  end

  # This method is called by SketchUp to determine if the "Options"
  # button inside the File > Import dialog should be enabled while your
  # importer is selected.
  #
  # @example
  #   def supports_options?
  #     return true
  #   end
  #
  # @return [Boolean] supports_options - a boolean
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def supports_options?
  end
