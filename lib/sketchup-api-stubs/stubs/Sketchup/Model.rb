# This is the interface to a SketchUp model. The model is the 3D drawing that
# the user is working with, and it serves as the "entry point" for most Ruby
# API interactions. The Sketchup.active_model method gives you a handle to the
# current model, and from there you can use the model-level methods to start
# getting information and making changes.

# @bug Prior to SketchUp 2019.0 this class would yield +TypeError+ for all

  # Instance Methods

  # The {#abort_operation} method aborts the current operation started with the
  # start_operation method.
  #
  # The {#abort_operation} method is normally called from inside of a rescue
  # clause to cancel an operation if something goes wrong.
  #
  # @example
  #   status = model.abort_operation
  #
  # @note Never abort a transparent operation. Doing so would abort the operation
  #   it chains to. Instead, try to clean up and simply commit in order to make
  #   sure the operation is closed.
  #
  # @return [Boolean] true if successful, false if unsuccessful
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def abort_operation
  end

  # Returns an {Sketchup::Entities} object which contains
  # the entities in the open group or component instance. If no group or
  # component is open for editing then this will be the same as {#entities}.
  #
  # To perform actions upon the current set of entities the user is working with
  # then this is the method to use. Entities selected by the user will be a
  # subset of the active entities.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   entities = model.active_entities
  #   entities.each { |entity| puts "#{entity} (#{entity.class})" }
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::Entities]
  #
  # @see #edit_transform
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def active_entities
  end

  # The {#active_layer} method retrieves the active Layer.
  #
  # The default layer in SketchUp is layer 0.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   layer = model.active_layer
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::Layer]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def active_layer
  end

  # The {#active_layer=} method sets the active {Sketchup::Layer} object.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   layers = model.layers
  #   layer = layers.add('My Layer')
  #   model.active_layer = layer
  #
  # @param [Sketchup::Layer] layer
  #   The layer to be set as the active layer.
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::Layer]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def active_layer=(layer)
  end

  # Returns an array containing the sequence of entities the user has
  # double-clicked on for editing. This allows one to determine whether they are
  # in component edit mode and where in the model they are.
  #
  # For example, if a user has double-clicked into a component to
  # edit its geometry, and then double clicked into a sub-group to edit that,
  # the active_path might contain:
  #
  # <code>[<Sketchup::ComponentInstance>, <Sketchup::Group>]</code>
  #
  # @example
  #   active_path = Sketchup.active_model.active_path
  #
  # @return [Array<Sketchup::Drawingelement>, nil] array of entities showing where the user is
  #   currently editing.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 7.0
  def active_path
  end

  # The {#active_path=} method is used to open a given instance path for editing.
  #
  # @example Open an instance
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   instance = model.active_entities.grep(Sketchup::ComponentInstance).first
  #   instance_path = Sketchup::InstancePath.new([instance])
  #   model.active_path = instance_path
  #
  # @example Close all instances
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   model.active_path = nil
  #
  # @note An instance path can only be opened if the instances are not locked.
  #   This also include instances of the same component definition that are not
  #   on the given path. A definition cannot be edited if any of its instances
  #   are locked.
  #
  # @note Since changing the active entities in SketchUp also changes what
  #   coordinate system is used, entities can't be modified in the same operation
  #   as the active entities changes. The API handles this automatically by
  #   starting and committing transparent operations as needed.
  #
  #   If the API user tries to do this:
  #
  #       model.start_operation('...', true)
  #       model.active_entities.add_face(...)
  #       model.active_path = instance_path
  #       model.active_entities.add_face(...)
  #       model.commit_operation
  #
  #   Then SketchUp will automatically break it up to something like to this:
  #
  #       model.start_operation('...', true)
  #       model.active_entities.add_face(...)
  #       model.commit_operation
  #
  #       model.start_operation('...', true, false, true)

  #
  #       model.start_operation('...', true, false, true)
  #       model.active_entities.add_face(...)
  #       model.commit_operation
  #
  #   For the end user this will be experienced as a single operation.
  #
  #   For the API user the side-effect is multiple transaction notifications to
  #   {Sketchup::ModelObserver}s.
  #

  # necessarily in the same order in which the user selected them.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   selection = model.selection
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::Selection] A Selection object with 0 or more entities
  #   that are currently selected.

  # This method is used to set the value of an attribute in an attribute
  # dictionary with the given name.
  #
  # This method can be used create a new AttributeDictionary object, if needed.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   value = model.set_attribute('attributedictionaryname', 'key', 'value')
  #
  # @param [String] attrdictname
  #   The name of the attribute dictionary whose attribute
  #   you wish to set.
  #
  # @param [String] key
  #   The attribute name.
  #
  # @param [Object] value
  #   The value to set.
  #
  # @return [Object] the value that was set
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def set_attribute(attrdictname, key, value)
  end

  # This method sets the datum used in conversions between the internal
  # coordinate system and UTM.
  #
  # The default datum is WGS84. You can use the method list_datums to get a list
  # of all of the datums supported in SketchUp. If you pass an invalid datum to
  # set_datum, set_datum returns the default datum.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   value = model.set_datum('Adindan')
  #
  # @param [String] datum
  #
  # @return [nil]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def set_datum(datum)
  end

  # This method is used to retrieve the shadow information for the Model.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   shadowinfo = model.shadow_info
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::ShadowInfo]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def shadow_info

  # The {#start_operation} method is used to notify SketchUp that a new
  # operation (which can be undone) is starting.
  #
  # The +op_name+ argument is a description for the operation that is displayed
  # adjacent to the Edit > Undo menu item. Make sure to provide a user friendly
  # name for your operation.
  #
  # Starting with SketchUp 7.0, there are three additional booleans that one can
  # pass in when starting an operation. It is recommended to always set
  # +disable_ui+ to +true+. It's left to +false+ for default for compatibility
  # reasons.
  #
  # @example Observer Operation since SU2016
  #   class MyDefinitionsObserver < Sketchup::DefinitionObserver
  #     def onComponentAdded(definitions, definition)
  #       return if definition.deleted?
  #       # The operation name won't be displayed when the fourth argument is
  #       # +true+. It will absorb into the previous operation.
  #       definition.model.start_operation('Tag It', true, false, true)
  #       definition.set_attribute('MyExtension', 'Tag', 'You are it')
  #       definition.model.commit_operation
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   observer = MyDefinitionsObserver.new
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   model.definitions.add_observer(observer)
  #
  # @example Typical Operation
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   model.start_operation('Generate House', true)
  #   model.entities.add_line([0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0])
  #   model.entities.add_line([9, 0, 0], [9, 0, 9])
  #   model.commit_operation
  #
  # @note Operations in SketchUp are sequential and cannot be nested. If you start a
  #   new Ruby operation while another is still open, you will implicitly close
  #   the first one.
  #
  # @param [String] op_name
  #   name of the operation visible in the UI
  #
  # @param [Boolean] disable_ui
  #   if set to true, then SketchUp's tendency to
  #   update the user interface after each geometry change will be
  #   suppressed. This can result in much faster Ruby code execution if the
  #   operation involves updating the model in any way.
  #
  # @param [Boolean] next_transparent
  #   <b>Deprecated!</b> if set to true, then
  #   whatever operation comes after this one will be appended into one
  #   combined operation, allowing the user the undo both actions with a
  #   single undo command. This flag is a highly difficult one, since there
  #   are so many ways that a SketchUp user can interrupt a given operation
  #   with one of their own. <b>Use extreme caution</b> and test thoroughly
  #   when setting this to true.
  #
  # @param [Boolean] transparent
  #   if set to true, then this operation will
  #   append to the previous operation. This is particularly useful for
  #   creating observers that react to user actions without littering the
  #   undo stack with extra steps that Ruby is performing.
  #
  # @raise [RuntimeError] if called within the context of {Sketchup::Entities#build}.
  #
  # @return [Boolean] +true+ if successful, +false+ if unsuccessful
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0

  # The {#styles} method retrieves the styles associated with the model.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   styles = model.styles
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::Styles]
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0

  end

  # The tags method retrieves the string tags of the model.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   tags = model.tags
  #
  # @return [String] string tags of the model
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def tags
  end

  # The tags= method sets the string tags of the model.
  #
  # @example
  #   Sketchup.active_model.tags = "Building, House, Brick"
  #
  # @param [String] tags
  #   new tags of the model
  #
  # @return [String] the new tags
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def tags=(tags)
  end

  # The tile method retrieves the name of the model. If the model is saved on
  # disk, returns the file name without extension. Otherwise returns an empty
  # string.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   title = model.title
  #
  # @return [String] the title of the model or an empty string (if
  #   the title is not set)
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0

  end

  # The {#tools} method is used to retrieve the current {Sketchup::Tools} object.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   tools = model.tools
  #
  # @return [Sketchup::Tools] a Tools object.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def tools
  end

  # The utm_to_point method converts a position given in UTM coordinates to a
  # Point3d in the Model.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   utm = Geom::UTM.new([+1, "A", 0.12333333, 0.12321321])
  #   point = model.utm_to_point(utm)
  #
  # @param [Geom::UTM] utm
  #   A UTM object.
  #
  # @return [Geom::Point3d] A Point3d object.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def utm_to_point(utm)
  end

  # Determine if a model is a valid Sketchup::Model object. Returns false
  # if the model has been closed.
  #
  # This is useful on the mac where one can have multiple models open at the
  # same time. In such a case, this method can tell you if the user has closed
  # the model before you perform operations on it.
  #
  # @example
  #   # This is a silly example since the active model is generally going to
  #   # be valid, but it illustrates the idea.
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   if model.valid?
  #     UI.messagebox('This model is valid.')
  #   else
  #     UI.messagebox('This model is NOT valid.')
