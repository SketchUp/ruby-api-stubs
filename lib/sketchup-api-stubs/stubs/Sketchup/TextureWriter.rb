# The TextureWriter class is used primarily for writing the textures used in a
# SketchUp model out to files as part of an export for use in another
# application. These methods are usually invoked in this order:
#
#   - 1. load - load one or more textures from a model into the TextureWriter.
#   - 2. write_all or write - write the texture(s) to file.
#
# @example
#   # This code snippet sets up a texture writer and some variables that are
#   # used in the following texture writer examples.
#   # Assumptions:
#   # 1) The active model contains at least one entity at the root level of the
#   #    following types: component instance, group, or image.
#   # 2) The active model contains at least one face at the root level.
#   model = Sketchup.active_model
#   entities = model.entities
#   faces = entities.grep(Sketchup::Face)
#   texturable_entities = entities.select{ |ent|
#       (ent.is_a?(Sketchup::ComponentInstance) ||
#        ent.is_a?(Sketchup::Group) || ent.is_a?(Sketchup::Image)) }
#   tw = Sketchup.create_texture_writer
#
# @version SketchUp 6.0
class Sketchup::TextureWriter

  # Instance Methods

  # The {#length} method is used to determine the number of textures loaded into
  # the texture writer.
  #
  # The {#count} method is an alias for {#length}.
  #
  # @example
  #   length = tw.length
  #   tw.load(texturable_entities[0])
  #   if length < tw.length
  #     puts("A new entity was successfully loaded into the writer.")
  #   end
  #
  # @return [Integer] length - the number of textures loaded in the texture
  #   writer
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def count
  end

  # The filename method is used to retrieve the original filename for a
  # particular texture.
  #
  # @example
  #   index = tw.load(texturable_entities[0])
  #   filename = tw.filename(index)
  #   puts("filename = #{filename}")
  #
  # @param [Integer] handle
  #   The index or handle of the texture in the texture
  #   writer.
  #
  # @return [String] filename - the filename of the texture on the file system.
  #   Textures can be generated without filenames, so if the
  #   texture doesn't have a name write_all will save the
  #   texture to an image file named "i.png". Where i is the
  #   first integer greater than zero which was not already used
  #   for a png file name.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def filename(handle)
  end

  # The handle method is used to retrieve a handle or index for a specific
  # texture in the texture writer.
  #
  # @example
  #   tw.load(texturable_entities[0])
  #   handle = tw.handle(texturable_entities[0])
  #
  # @example
  #   load_front_face = true
  #   tw.load(faces[0], load_front_face)
  #   handle = tw.handle(faces[0], load_front_face)
  #
  # @overload handle(entity)
  #
  #   @param [Sketchup::Entity] entity  A image, component instance, group, or
  #                                     layer.
  #   @return [Integer] the index for the entity in the texture writer.
  #
  # @overload handle(face, side)
  #
  #   @param [Sketchup::Face] face
  #   @param [Boolean] side  Specifies one of the sides of the face
  #                          (true if front, false if back.)
  #   @return [Integer] the index for the entity in the texture writer.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def handle(*args)
  end

  # The {#length} method is used to determine the number of textures loaded into
  # the texture writer.
  #
  # The {#count} method is an alias for {#length}.
  #
  # @example
  #   length = tw.length
  #   tw.load(texturable_entities[0])
  #   if length < tw.length
  #     puts("A new entity was successfully loaded into the writer.")
  #   end
  #
  # @return [Integer] length - the number of textures loaded in the texture
  #   writer
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def length
  end

  # The load method is used to load one or more textures into the texture writer
  # for writing out to a file.
  #
  # @example
  #   index = tw.load(texturable_entities[0])
  #
  # @example
  #   index = tw.load(faces[0], true)
  #
  # @note If you are passing a face in as the entity argument when loading a
  #   texture you will have to specify the second boolean argument, side.
  #   The argument side specifies which side of the face the texture will be
  #   loaded from.
  #
  # @overload load(entity)
  #
  #   @param [Sketchup::Entity] entity Image, component instance, group, or layer
  #                                      to load.
  #   @return [Integer] handle - the index or handle of the entity that was
  #                     loaded
  #
  # @overload load(face, side)
  #
  #   @param [Sketchup::Face] face A face to load.
  #   @param [Boolean] side        A boolean used to indicate the side of the
  #                                face being loaded (true if front, false if
  #                                back).
  #   @return [Integer] handle - the index or handle of the entity that was
  #                     loaded
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def load(*args)
  end

  # The write method is used to write an individual textures, within the texture
  # writer, to a file. An entity's texture must have been loaded into the texture
  # writer before this method can be used to write it's texture.
  #
  # This method will return one of the following status messages. (These are
  # constants that are defined by the API.)
  #
  #   - 0 = FILE_WRITE_OK
  #   - 1 = FILE_WRITE_FAILED_INVALID_TIFF
  #   - 2 = FILE_WRITE_FAILED_UNKNOWN
  #
  # @example
  #   tw.load(texturable_entities[0])
  #   if tw.write(texturable_entities[0], "C:\\textures\\A.jpg") == FILE_WRITE_OK
  #     puts("JPEG file successfully written.")
  #   end
  #
  # @example
  #   tw.load(faces[0], true)
  #   if tw.write(faces[0], true, "C:\\textures\\Face.png") == FILE_WRITE_OK
  #     puts("PNG file successfully written.")

  #
  # @note If you are passing a face in as the entity argument when writing a

  #                                    texture.
  #   @return [Integer] status - one of three status messages (see comments.)

  # @overload write(entity, side, filename)
