# The Behavior class is used to control the "behavior" of components, which
# roughly correlates to the series of options that you see in the
# Components dialog under the "edit" tab, such as whether it casts shadows,
# glues to walls, etc.
#
# A Behavior object is accessed from a ComponentDefinition object, not created
# with a Behavior.new call.
#
# @example
#   # Grab the Behavior object from the first component definition.
#   model = Sketchup.active_model
#   definition = model.definitions[0]

  # Instance Methods

  # The always_face_camera= method is used to set the always_face_camera
  # behavior for a component.
  #
  # If the always_face_camera behavior is true, a component will always try to
  # orient itself so that the Y axis of the component is facing the camera.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   behavior = model.definitions[0].behavior
  #   status = behavior.always_face_camera = false
  #
  # @param setting
  #   Sets the always_face_camera behavior to true or false.
  #
  # @return status - the status of the always_face_camera behavior.
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def always_face_camera=(setting)
  end

  # The always_face_camera? method is used to retrieve the  always_face_camera
  # behavior for a component.
  #
  # If the always_face_camera behavior is true, then a component will always try
  # to orient itself so that the -Y axis of the component is facing the camera.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   # Returns a DefinitionList
  #   definitions = model.definitions
  #   path = Sketchup.find_support_file "Bed.skp",
  #     "Components/Components Sampler/"
  #
  #   begin
  #     definition = definitions.load path
  #   rescue
  #     UI.messagebox $!.message
  #   end
  #
  #   behavior = definition.behavior
  #   b = behavior.always_face_camera?
  #   if (b)
  #     UI.messagebox b
  #   else
  #     UI.messagebox "Always Face Camera is equal to false"
  #   end

  #   b = behavior.always_face_camera?
  #   if (b)
  #     UI.messagebox b
  #   else
  #     UI.messagebox "Failure"
  #   end

  # @return [Boolean] behavior - true if the component is set to always face
  #   the camera, false if the component is not set to always
  #   face camera.

  # The cuts_opening= method is used to set the cut opening behavior for a
  # component.
  #
  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model
  #   behavior = model.definitions[0].behavior
  #   behavior.cuts_opening = false
  #
  # @note To enable cut opening, also set {#is2d=} to true.

  #   (either true or false)

  #   status = behavior.cuts_opening?
  #
  # @return [Boolean]

  # @example
  #   model = Sketchup.active_model

  #     # We can also set what planes component can glue to.

  # Sets an integer that is really a bit-by-bit description of which scale
  # tool handles are hidden on a given component. This is useful for creating
  # definitions that can only be scaled in particular ways. If a bit contains a
  # a 1, then a certain handle set will be hidden when the user selects the
  # component and activates the Scale tool. Here is the map of which bits
  # control which handles.
  #
  # - Bit0: disable scale along red (X),
  # - Bit1: disable scale along green (Y),
  # - Bit2: disable scale along blue (Z),
  # - Bit3: disable scale in red/blue plane (X+Z),
  # - Bit4: disable scale in green/blue plane (Y+Z),
  # - Bit5: disable scale in red/green plane (X+Y),
  # - Bit6: disable scale uniform (from corners) (XYZ).
  #
  # Note that for 2-dimensional components (such as face-me components), not all
  # of the handles in the list above are even used. Also, if the component you
  # are modifying is already selected with the scale tool, then you or your user
  # must deactivate and reactivate the scale tool for your new behavior to take
  # effect.
  #
  # @example
  #   # Disable the green and red-axes handles by setting bits 1 and 2 to 1.
  #   definition = Sketchup.active_model.definitions[0]
  #   behavior = definition.behavior
  #   behavior.no_scale_mask = (1 << 1) + (1 << 2)

  # The no_scale_mask? method returns an integer that is a bit-by-bit
  # description of which scale tool handles are hidden when the user selects
  # this single component with the scale tool. See the no_scale_mask=
  # method for details on the bit encodings used.
  #
  # @example

  # The {#snapto} method is used to see how a component can glue to other
  # entities.
  #
  # Returns a value indicating the snapping behavior of the component. Snapping

  # - +SnapTo_Horizontal+ => Snap to horizontal face like floors,

  # - +SnapTo_Sloped+ => Snap to sloped face like sloping roofs.
