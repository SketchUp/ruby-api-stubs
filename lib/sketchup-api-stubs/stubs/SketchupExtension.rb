# The SketchupExtension class contains methods allowing you to create and
# manipulate SketchUp extensions. Extensions are Ruby scripts that can be
# loaded and unloaded using the Extension manager (Extensions panel of the
# Preferences dialog box). Generally you should register your ruby scripts as
# an extension to give SketchUp users the ability to disable it through the
# user interface.
#
# The idea here is to take the ruby script that actually creates your
# functionality and place it in a folder somewhere outside of the /Plugins
# folder, most commonly a subdirectory like /Plugins/MyExtension. Then
# you create a new ruby script inside the /Plugins directory that will
# set up the extension entry and load your original script if the user
# has your extension turned on.
#
# Here is an example extension loading script. For this example, the
# following code would be saved in /Plugins/StairTools.rb, and the
# actual plugin itself would live in /Plugins/StairTools/core.rb.
#
# You can find two example extensions that ship with SketchUp,
# su_dynamiccomponents.rb and su_sandboxtools.rb, under the /Plugins/ folder.
#
# @example
#   # Create an entry in the Extension list that loads a script called
#   # core.rb.
#   require 'sketchup.rb'
#   require 'extensions.rb'
#
#   stair_extension = SketchupExtension.new('Stair Tools", "StairTools/core.rb')
#   stair_extension.version = '1.0'
#   stair_extension.description = 'Tools to draw stairs automatically.'
#   Sketchup.register_extension(stair_extension, true)
#
# @version SketchUp 6.0
class SketchupExtension

  # Instance Methods

  # Loads the extension, meaning the underlying ruby script is immediately
  # interpreted. This is the equivalent of checking the extension's checkbox
  # in the Preferences > Extensions list.
  #
  # @example
  #   # This will register the extension, a necessary step for it to appear
  #   # in SketchUp's Preferences > Extensions list
  #   ext_c = SketchupExtension.new('Stair Tools C', 'StairTools/core.rb')
  #   Sketchup.register_extension(ext_c, false)
  #
  #   # And this will load the extension.
  #   ext_c.check
  #
  # @return [Boolean] whether the load succeeded
  #
  # @version SketchUp 8.0 M2
  def check
  end

  # The copyright method returns the copyright string which appears beneath
  # an extension inside the Extensions Manager dialog.
  #
  # @example
  #   # Create an entry in the Extension list that loads a script called
  #   # core.rb.
  #   extension = SketchupExtension.new('Stair Tools', 'StairTools/core.rb')
  #   extension.copyright = '2008'
  #   copyright = extension.copyright
  #
  # @return [String] the Extension copyright
  #
  # @version SketchUp 6.0
  def copyright
  end

  # The copyright= method sets the copyright string which appears beneath
  # an extension inside the Extensions Manager dialog.
  #
  # @example
  #   # Create an entry in the Extension list that loads a script called
  #   # core.rb.
  #   extension = SketchupExtension.new('Stair Tools', 'StairTools/core.rb')
  #   extension.copyright = '2008'
  #   copyright = extension.copyright

  # @return [String] the new copyright

  # The creator method returns the creator string which appears beneath
  # an extension inside the Extensions Manager dialog.
  #
  # @example
  #   # Create an entry in the Extension list that loads a script called

  #   extension = SketchupExtension.new('Stair Tools', 'StairTools/core.rb')

  # The new method is used to create a new SketchupExtension object. Note
  # that once the extension object is created, it will not appear in the

  # @example

  #   # Then be sure to register it. By passing a 2nd param of true, you're

  # @note It is recommended to omit the file extension provided in the +path+
  #   argument. SketchUp will resolve the file extension to +.rbe+, +.rbs+
  #   or +.rb+.

  # @param [String] title
  #   The name of the extension
