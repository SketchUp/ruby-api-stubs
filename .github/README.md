# SketchUp Ruby API Stubs

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sketchup-api-stubs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sketchup-api-stubs) ![Build status](https://github.com/sketchup/sketchup-yard-template/actions/workflows/rake.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Auto-generated stubs for the SketchUp Ruby API. Useful for IDE intellisense and auto-complete.

This is currently a work in progress and it may change a lot in the near future.

The stubs are automatically generated by a YARD template which we will publish in our sketchup-yard-template repository: https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-yard-template

Guidance on how to set up editors to use the stubs will come.
